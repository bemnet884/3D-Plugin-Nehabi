## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage  

### Embedding Models:  
Use the `[multiviewer]` shortcode to add a 3D model to your content.  

**Syntax:**  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="TYPE" src="MODEL_URL" width="WIDTH" height="HEIGHT" background="BACKGROUND" border="BORDER" shadow="SHADOW" padding="PADDING"]  
```  

**Parameters:**  
- `type` (required): Platform type (`spline` or `sketchfab`).  
- `src` (required): URL of the 3D model or embed iframe.  
- `width` (optional): Viewer width (default: `100%`).  
- `height` (optional): Viewer height (default: `500px`).  
- `background` (optional): Background color (default: `transparent`).  
- `border` (optional): Border style (default: `none`).  
- `shadow` (optional): Box shadow (default: `none`).  
- `padding` (optional): Padding (default: `0`).  

### Examples:  

#### Spline Model:  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="spline" src="https://my.spline.design/molang3dcopy-fcfc5f52ce2d056f6bf215b94f76c0da/" width="100%" height="500px" background="transparent"]  
```  

#### Sketchfab Model:  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="sketchfab" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/example-id/embed" width="800px" height="600px" border="1px solid #000"]

## üñ±Ô∏è Admin Dashboard Features  

The plugin includes a user-friendly admin page to generate shortcodes:  
1. Choose the model type (Spline or Sketchfab).
2. Enter the model URL.  
3. Adjust viewer properties like width, height, background, border, shadow, and padding.  
4. Generate the shortcode instantly.

## **‚úÖ URL Validation**  

The plugin ensures secure and seamless embedding of 3D models by validating URLs from trusted platforms (**Spline** and **Sketchfab**) before they are accepted. This robust validation process guarantees that only supported and secure URLs are used, protecting users from errors or malicious content.  

### **Key Features of URL Validation**  
- **Secure Protocol**: Only URLs starting with `https://` are accepted, ensuring encrypted and secure data transmission.  
- **Platform-Specific Validation**: Ensures the domain belongs to either `spline.design` or `sketchfab.com`, avoiding unsupported or harmful links.  
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid URL is detected, users receive clear error messages, making the process intuitive and user-friendly.  

This validation process reinforces the plugin‚Äôs reliability and prioritizes user trust by ensuring the integrity of embedded content.

## üìù Additional Notes on Customizations  

Some customizations for the embedded 3D models may need to be done on the respective platforms (Spline or Sketchfab) and may require premium subscriptions.  

### üéØ Specific Considerations:  

- **Spline**:  
  - To remove the Spline logo or watermark from the embedded models, you must make adjustments within the Spline platform. This option might only be available to users with a premium subscription.  
  - Background removal and other customization options should also be configured directly in Spline before embedding the model.  

- **Sketchfab**:  
  - Buttons like fullscreen, annotations, or Sketchfab branding in the viewer can only be customized through Sketchfab's settings. Some of these features may also require a premium account.  

These platform-specific customizations cannot be managed directly through the plugin and must be configured externally before embedding the models.

## **‚è© Future Enhancements**  

- **Support for Local Files (GLTF/GLB):**  
  Planned for future versions, enabling users to upload and render local 3D models.  

- **AR/VR Interactivity:**  
  Expand functionality for immersive, next-gen web experiences.  

- **Advanced Styling Options:**  
  Additional iframe properties for precise control.
